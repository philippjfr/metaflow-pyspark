"""Unity Catalog tables as Metaflow artifacts.

The central idea: **the artifact is a table reference, not a copy of the table.**

    self.orders = UnityCatalogTable("main.retail.orders")

Assignment pins the table's current Delta version, so re-running the flow reads the same
bytes even if the table has moved on. That extends Metaflow's reproducibility guarantee
over data the customer governs in Unity Catalog, without copying it and without taking
governance away from UC.

Reads can happen two ways:

*Through Spark*, with ``to_spark(session)``, which is what you want when the data is
large or the work is a join.

*Without any cluster*, with ``to_arrow()``, which asks Unity Catalog to vend temporary,
scoped cloud credentials for the table's storage location and reads the Delta files
directly. Governance is preserved because UC issues the credentials and enforces the
grants; there is simply no Spark involved. For mid-size tables this is dramatically
cheaper than starting a cluster.

A table with deletion vectors enabled, the default on recent Databricks Runtimes for
many write patterns, cannot be read by the ``deltalake`` package's reader at all: it does
not support that protocol feature on any of its read methods, as of the latest release at
the time this was written (1.6.3). ``to_arrow()`` falls back to DuckDB's own Delta
reader for that case, which does apply deletion vectors correctly. Covers AWS and Azure
SAS credentials (see ``_read_via_duckdb``'s docstring for exactly how well-verified each
is); GCP has no DuckDB secret shape for the OAuth bearer token UC vends. Install
``duckdb`` to get the fallback; without it, or on GCP, a table with deletion vectors fails
with an explanation rather than a raw stack trace, pointing at ``query()`` on a SQL
warehouse.

        parameter for an already-obtained bearer token either. AWS is verified end to
        end, including against a real deletion-vector table (see
        tests/test_unity_catalog.py). Azure SAS was verified against a real Azure
        workspace and initially failed: the connection string needs `AccountName=`
        in it, not just `BlobEndpoint=`/`SharedAccessSignature=` (Microsoft's own
        documented minimal format for a SAS-based connection string, which omits
        `AccountName`); duckdb-azure's own pre-check
        (`ConnectionStringMatchStorageAccountName` in
        `azure_storage_account_client.cpp`) requires it and throws before ever
        reaching the real Azure SDK parser if it is missing. With it, reads against a
        real Azure workspace succeed, including pinned reads of older versions.

        Every failure here, including a vending refusal on top of the protocol
        error, ends up at the same explanation, but with a specific reason attached
        rather than a second, unrelated-looking error: `credentials()`'s own
        "refused to vend" message escaping instead would bury the actual cause (the
        table's protocol, not a missing grant).
