"""Demo 4a: put Metaflow in front of pipelines that already exist.

    python orchestrate.py run

Nothing on the Databricks side changes. The jobs keep their Asset Bundle definitions,
their permissions, their schedules, and their owners. Metaflow triggers them, waits, reads
their task values, and then does the part Databricks Workflows is not good at: fanning out
over the results and training somewhere else.

`@databricks_job` takes either `job_id` or `job_name`. Names are nicer to read and get
resolved to an id at submit time, so a job recreated by a bundle deploy keeps working.
