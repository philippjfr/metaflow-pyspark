"""Per-step environments, secrets, and settings for running the demos on Outerbounds.

    python hello_spark.py --environment=fast-bakery run --with kubernetes

Every demo step carries one `@step_env(...)`. On a laptop (the default `local` environment)
it is a no-op, so the demos keep running in whatever environment you installed the
extension into. Under a virtual environment such as `fast-bakery`, it attaches:

* `@anaconda`, resolved from Anaconda's main channel, for every step it can serve;
* `@pypi` for steps that need a package Anaconda's channel cannot supply:
  `databricks-connect` is published on PyPI only, and `deltalake` (version pinning and
  credential vending) is on conda-forge only, as an abi3 build that requires
  conda-forge's own Python;
* `@secrets` for the Databricks host and token;
* `@environment` forwarding the non-secret settings below, which would otherwise stay
  behind on the laptop.

The environment is read from the command line rather than a toggle variable because task
pods are started with the same `--environment` flag, so they see the same decorators.

Each demo directory links to this file, so `import _env` works from the directory the
demo is run from and Metaflow packages it with the flow.
